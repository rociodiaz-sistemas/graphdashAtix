Hey! I'll be giving you the instructions to use my application ðŸ˜€.
Clone my repo from my github!
https://github.com/rociodiaz-sistemas/graphDashAtix
My email is rochurosh38@gmail.com if you need to contact me.

-IMPORTANT-
I'm using
https://mockapi.io/
please make an account and pass me the user so you can manage the resources and test the app!

Just npm-install and npm start,
The final version is in master branch.

I'm using:
-Redux Saga for my store, and connected-react-router for the routes.
-Axios for api calls.
-UI Semantic for the ui layout and a small carousel library for my instructions.

That's it! Happy testing and coding :)
